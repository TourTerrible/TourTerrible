_Alhamdulillah!, I graduated, I graduated from IIT Guwahati._


In my Hometown, most people do not even know about IIT. I don't exactly remember who told me about IIT;  I guess I was in 8th standard, and I remember asking my father for admission into FIITJEE, but It was not possible considering the coaching institute charging high fees. Then someone<!--break-->  told me about Dakshana, an NGO that provides free coaching for IITJEE, and that was it. I started burning the midnight oil, made it to Dakshana Bundi (Kota), worked hard with focus, and got admitted to IIT Guwahati on 21 July 2018.

Fast forward to today, I graduated from IIT Guwahati, a beautiful place where I spent fabulous four (two and a half) years, learned so much, met new people, and whatnot.

You may say, "It is just a degree," but what makes this degree important is the sacrifices behind it. Sacrifices made by me, my mother, and my father and my people.
During my coaching period of 2 years at JNV Bundi, Rajasthan, I went home only once because I was not allowed. I used to talk to my parents once or twice weekly because we were not allowed to keep mobile phones. I sacrificed my health at the peak time of teenage and so much more but everything seems worth it.
When I left JNV Bundi, the world was different; everyone was using 4G, which seemed impossible two years back when I entered. I did not know about current affairs and basically anything outside the world. I was totally cut off from the outside world.

I remember my JEE advance not going as expected, but I was lucky that I got admitted to IITG.
Sometimes I think people don't give enough credit to luck. I believe being lucky is as important as being intelligent to achieve something. I was lucky. I got IIT Guwahati EEE in 2nd round, and I looked at the campus tour videos daily until I joined it.

10 years back, I dreamed of getting into IIT, and I graduated this year. Alhamdulillah!

Yes, dreams come true!
